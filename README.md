This is a React Application that I'm building for an assignment at Epicodus. The basic purpose of this application is to act as a local busness inventory tracker. The users will have the ability too . . . 
* See a list or menu of all avaiable type of offe beans. 
* For each item, the user will see the name, orgin, price, quantity on hand, and roast (light, medium, or dark).
* Ability to add inventory, edit and see details on current inventory. 
* The unit of measure will be a "burlap sack" which is 130 pounds of beans. 
* Ability to sell a single pound of coffee.
